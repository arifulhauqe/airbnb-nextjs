# My Next.js App Documentation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the technologies and tools used in the My Next.js App project. It serves as a guide for understanding the structure, setup, and usage of the application.

## Technologies Used

1. **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation for building fast and user-friendly web applications.

2. **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, which helps in catching errors during development and improves code quality.

3. **Storybook**: A tool for developing UI components in isolation. It allows for building and testing components independently from the main application.

4. **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs without leaving your HTML.

5. **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need, making it more efficient than traditional REST APIs.

6. **REST APIs**: A standard way of building APIs that allows for communication between client and server using HTTP requests.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the main application code.
  - **pages/**: Contains the application's pages and API routes.
    - **api/**: Contains the API endpoints for GraphQL and REST.
  - **components/**: Contains reusable React components.
  - **graphql/**: Contains GraphQL queries, mutations, and schema definitions.
  - **styles/**: Contains global styles, including Tailwind CSS imports.
  - **types/**: Contains TypeScript types and interfaces.

- **.storybook/**: Contains configuration files for Storybook.

- **public/**: Contains static assets like images and icons.

- **Configuration Files**: Various configuration files for ESLint, PostCSS, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Next.js.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-nextjs-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**: 
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the Application**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

5. **Run Storybook**: 
   ```
   npm run storybook
   ```

6. **Access Storybook**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:6006`.

## Best Practices

- **Component Reusability**: Create reusable components in the `components` directory to promote code reuse and maintainability.

- **Type Safety**: Utilize TypeScript for type safety throughout the application to catch errors early in the development process.

- **GraphQL Queries and Mutations**: Organize GraphQL queries and mutations in separate files for better maintainability and readability.

- **Styling with Tailwind CSS**: Use Tailwind CSS utility classes to build responsive and modern designs without writing custom CSS.
